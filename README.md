This is just a simple lua for loop benchmark example running on defold.

You don't need this whole project, you can just copy the code from the benchmark module, main/scripts/loop_test.lua to try it in your own defold project.

This simple example runs the benchmark module every button click and sets the text on screen to the returned results. 

If you're lazy and want to try it on your own device I've uploaded exported release bundles for Android, HTML5, and Windows.
